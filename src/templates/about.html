 <h3><p>Why go Vegan?</p></h3>
   <p>More and more people are turning to a vegan diet for the health benefits: increased energy, younger looking skin and eternal youth are just some of the claims from enthusiastic plant eaters. Well, eternal youth might be a bit optimistic, but there are certainly many scientifically proven benefits to vegan living when compared to the average western diet.</p>
   <p>Well-planned plant-based diets are rich in protein, iron, calcium and other essential vitamins and minerals. The plant-based sources of these nutrients tend to be low in saturated fat, high in fibre and packed with antioxidants, helping mitigate some of the modern world's biggest health issues like obesity, heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Check out our fully referenced article on health and the vegan diet here. For more information on living a healthy, vegan life, our nutrition section will be able to help.</p>
    <p><strong>Vegan Recipes</strong> is where you can find easy to do vegan recipes. Easy to follow recipes with minimal ingredients for those who like delicious food but donâ€™t want to slave for a million hours in the kitchen! Affordable and easy-to-find ingredients (no vegan cheeses, butters or fake meats!). Tons of lazy recipes that take less than 15 minutes to make. Mostly oil-free recipes</p>
